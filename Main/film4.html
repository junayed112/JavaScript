    <h3>Storyline</h3>
    <p>Dastan, a street urchin in Persia, is adopted by King Sharaman after showing courage.
    Fifteen years later, the king's brother Nizam relays evidence to the princes—Dastan, along with the king's biological sons Tus and Garsiv—that the holy city of Alamut is forging weapons for Persia's enemies. 
    Tus directs the Persian army to capture Alamut. 
    Dastan and his friends breach the city and open a gate for the siege. During the attack, Dastan defeats a royal guard and takes from him a sacred dagger.</p>
