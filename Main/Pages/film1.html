    <h3>Storyline</h1>
    <p>Students Farhan and Raju join the prestigious Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) in Delhi but struggle in the cutthroat academic culture.
        Farhan is passionate about photography and only chose engineering to appease his father, while Raju lacks self confidence.
        However, their roommate, the eccentric Rancho, is passionate about learning and excels in class.
        Rancho's approach to education results in him being at odds with the college's staff and its director, Viru aka Virus.
        Virus has an iron grip on the college and enforces a strict exam-based teaching model. A student named Joy Lobo commits suicide by hanging after failing to meet a deadline and being denied graduation. Rancho confronts Virus about the undue pressure placed on ICE students. One night, the trio gatecrash a wedding only to find out that the bride is none other than Virus's daughter Mona. An infuriated Virus tells Farhan and Raju that Rancho comes from an extremely wealthy family unlike them and thus would remain unaffected from potential fallout. Raju then distances himself from Rancho by moving to a room with Chatur who is competitive, arrogant and believes in learning by memorization. On the eve of exams, when Raju's paralyzed father experiences a medical emergency, Rancho saves his life with the help of Virus' younger daughter Pia. At the end of the year, Rancho is shown to have topped the college's rankings despite his disdain for its academic system, while Farhan and Raju continue to fall behind.</p>
